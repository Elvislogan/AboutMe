    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is ElThunder.
\n\nI love Programming.
\n\nI see myself as a problem solver.
\nFun fact is that I love programming so much that when a new technology is out, I put in effort to learn.
\n\nAnother fun fact is that the name, El-Thunder is a nickname given to me by my Code geek friends because of the way I am when it comes to programming.
\n\nI like programming with these languages; Kotlin, PHP with frameworks such as CodeIgniter and Laravel, Javascript with framework such as Vue. I use IDE\'s such as Android Studio and Visual Studio Code
\nAnd sometimes I try new things, languages, tools and IDE\'s in programming.
\nAll these things I learn from various community meetups; GDG, DevFest, ForLoop, Andela, Laravel and Wordpress communities.
\n\nI have worked as a Front End developer, Back End Developer in different companies for about 4years now. I have also written API using REST, done API testing and written documentation using POSTMAN.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to program.
\nYou should ask someone else about programming, though.\n\n</string>
